What is your site's primary purpose?
    To document my work during my time at Dev Academy.
Who is your target audience?
    The dev academy staff and cohort, and friends and family who I show the site to.
How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
    I think that primarily the site is more for me to practice my skills, but obviously it would be nice for others to be impressed by it. So I would like them to be able to easily navigate around the site and be able to move quickly through the site intuitively.
How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
    I will start with mobile because while Dev Academy staff and cohort will likely be viewing on desktop, friends and family will more likely be seeing the site from mobile.
    I will focus on making everything easy to read, and the structure of the site easy to navigate.
